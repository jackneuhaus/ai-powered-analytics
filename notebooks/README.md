# AI-Powered Analytics (Demo Project)

This project is a demonstration of an end-to-end AI/Analytics pipeline inspired by real-world telecom and mobile network scenarios (similar to Open RAN / 4G / 5G environments).

The goal is to showcase:
- Synthetic generation of network data (traffic, latency, errors, cell performance, geolocation).
- Data processing and exploratory analysis.
- Anomaly detection using Machine Learning.
- Visualizations and a complete example notebook.

This repository is intended as a personal learning project and a technical showcase for roles in **Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and AI applied to telecom**.
